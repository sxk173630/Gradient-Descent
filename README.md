INTRODUCTION
------------
These files contain python code for implementing the gradient descent algorithm, and apply it to a linear regression problem that used a Beijing multi-site air-quality data set and compared the, CO concentration(carbon monoxide) by the TEMP(Temperature in celsius) with pre-processing included.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Code in Python for implementing the gradient descent algorithm, and applying it to a linear regression problem.

INSTALLATION
------------
I have the .py file, named,"Gradient_Descent", and, "PRSA_Data_Changping.txt", to implement the dataset.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
The original dataset link:
